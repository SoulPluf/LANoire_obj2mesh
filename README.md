# L.A. Noire_obj2mesh
**This script lets you swap the main menu text in L.A. Noire for any model you want**

On PC, the main menu is just a static image. But in the original console version, it was animated: like a shadow on a wall that changed when selecting options, moving, as if switching slides. This wasn't done with textures or fonts, but with 3D models. 

This script takes a flat 3D model from an OBJ file and inserts it into the PS4 versionâ€™s model file. This way, you can replace game files to translate the menu into another language or even replace text with an image.

## Usage:

python LANoire_obj2mesh.py obj_file mesh_file

## Example:

python LANoire_obj2mesh.py test.obj text_continue.normal_lod.chunk

## Notes:
The OBJ file template made in Blender is included. Replace the text with your own and convert it to a mesh.

For some unknown reason, the "NEW" menu line has a different vertex stride than all the others. To convert the "NEW" file, change the "stride" variable from 0x18 to 0x14.  

The script can only replace a model with the same (or fewer) vertices/faces as the original. If you try to convert a mesh with more vertices or faces, the script will give an error message and stop. In that case, reduce the number of vertices or polygons and try again.
